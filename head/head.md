The main element of the beetle head is the **cephalic capsule** or **cranium**, which is a rigid structure often divided into areas for descriptive purposes (Lawrence & Ślipiński 2013).
The beetle head was studied in detail by Stickney (1923) who included nearly 150 species representing over 100 families (families as listed by Leng 1920).

The head is the **tagma** containing the brain and mouth and located at the anterior end of insects, in front of the **thorax**. It bears the eyes and a group of **appendages** including the **antennae** and the **mouthparts**.

In dorsal view, from the posterior to the anterior end of the head (from the bottom in the image below), the first area of the head capsule is the **frons** (shaded in blue).
