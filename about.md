The **Coleoptera Anatomy Ontology Project (COLAO)** aims to integrate information about the anatomy and morphology of beetles across the order.
We will tackle this by creating an ontology of commonly used terms for taxonomic descriptions of beetles, accompanied by a referenced and illustrated glossary, which will be hosted on this site.
